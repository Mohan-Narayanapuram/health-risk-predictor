# Health Risk Predictor

A Machine Learning based system that predicts the **10-year risk of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)** using health parameters and provides a **health score and insurance recommendation**.

Developed as part of **Machine Learning for Data Analytics (MLDA)**.

---

## Project Overview

Cardiovascular diseases are one of the leading causes of death worldwide.  
This project uses **Machine Learning and clustering techniques** to predict health risks based on medical parameters.

The system:

• Predicts CHD probability  
• Calculates a health score using clustering  
• Classifies users into risk groups  
• Recommends suitable insurance plans

## Risk Categories

The clustering model divides individuals into:

| Cluster | Risk Level |
|------|------|
| Cluster 0 | Low Risk |
| Cluster 1 | Moderate Risk |
| Cluster 2 | High Risk |

---

## Model Performance

| Metric | Value |
|------|------|
| Accuracy | ~85% |
| Precision | ~91% |
| Recall | ~82% |
| F1 Score | ~15% |
| ROC-AUC | ~0.73 |
